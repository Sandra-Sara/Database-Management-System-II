How does the remapping of bad sectors by disk controllers affect data-retrieval rates?
When a disk controller detects a bad sector, it remaps that sector to a spare one.
This process adds extra seek time because the replacement sector might be far from the original position.
As a result, data retrieval becomes slower — especially if many bad sectors exist.
However, this remapping prevents data loss, so reliability is improved at the cost of slightly reduced performance.

Operating systems try to ensure that consecutive blocks of a file are stored on consecutive disk blocks. Why is this very important with magnetic disks? If SSDs were used instead,
is it still important? Explain why.
In magnetic disks (HDDs), reading consecutive blocks is faster because:
The read/write head doesn’t need to move much (less seek time).
Data can be read sequentially as the disk spins.
If blocks are scattered, the head must move frequently → increased seek time → slower performance.
In SSDs, there are no moving parts, so access time is uniform regardless of data location.
Thus, sequential block placement is less important for performance.
However, storing consecutively can still reduce fragmentation and simplify file management.
